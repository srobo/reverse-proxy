# Student Robotics Website Reverse Proxy

[![Build status][build-badge]][build-page]

The reverse proxy which pulls together all the pieces of the Student Robotics
public website.

## Getting Started

1. [Install Docker][docker]

2. Fetch the latest base image:
    ``` shell
    $ docker pull nginx
    ```

3. Build the image:
    ``` shell
    $ docker build --tag srobo/reverse-proxy .
    ```

4. Start the container:
    ``` shell
    $ docker run --rm -p 80:80 --name srobo srobo/reverse-proxy
    ```

   Note: You can change the bound ports so they don't conflict with your local
   host's configuration. For example, you might want to replace `-p 80:80` with
   ` -p 8080:80`.

5. Visit <http://localhost> in a browser (adjust the port as needed if you
   edited it), and confirm that you see a copy of the SR website (also check that
   you didn't get redirect to the real one!)

6. Make your changes to the [`nginx.conf`](nginx.conf)

7. Get those changes into the container and reload nginx:
    ``` shell
    $ docker cp nginx.conf srobo:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf && docker kill -s HUP srobo
    ```

8. Refresh your browser and bask in the glory of your changes

## Making changes

When you've made a change, either push it to a forked repository, or to a
feature branch, and [raise a pull request][raise-a-pr].

## Deployment

***Note**: full [deployment instructions](./DEPLOYMENT.md) are separate.*

The `master` branch of repo is built into a Docker image by [Circle CI][circle-ci]
which is then deployed manually into a Kubernetes hosted on DigitalOcean.
